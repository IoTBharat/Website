Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi was India’s most important political and spiritual leader. He is honoured in India as Father of the Nation. His non-violent protests led to independence for India from the British. His beliefs and actions have inspired civil rights movements across the globe. He is an icon of world peace. His birthday, 2nd October, is commemorated worldwide as the International Day of Non-Violence.

Gandhi was born in Gujarat, Western India, in 1869. He grew up surrounded by religious traditions of compassion, vegetarianism, and tolerance for all people. He got married at the age of 13. When he was 19, he went to London to study law. He returned to India to practice as a lawyer but was hampered by British officials, so he accepted a job in South Africa.
